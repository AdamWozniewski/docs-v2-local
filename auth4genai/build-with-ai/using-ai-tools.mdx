## Auth for GenAI MCP server
Connect your AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Windsurf, to the Auth for GenAI Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
This server enables your AI tools to access and query the most up-to-date Auth for GenAI documentation, ensuring more accurate, context-aware answers.

By connecting your AI tools to the Auth for GenAI MCP server, you can:

- Access the latest information: Get accurate, up-to-date answers on how to set up and integrate with Auth for GenAI.
- Search the documentation: Use natural language queries to search for information on quickstarts, integrations, SDKs, and more. Your AI tool will provide code snippets and direct links to relevant documentation to help you implement code changes.

<Note>Even with access to the most up-to-date documentation, AI tools can make mistakes. Always review AI-generated code for accuracy.</Note>

### MCP server connection info
Connect your AI tools to the MCP server using this information or follow one of our guides below.

- **Server Name:** Auth for GenAI
- **Server URL:** `https://auth0.com/ai/docs/mcp`
- **Transport Type:** HTTP

## How to use the Auth for GenAI Docs MCP server
After adding the MCP server to your AI tool, you can ask it questions about how to setup, configure, or integrate Auth for GenAI. AI coding agents will be able to automatically retrieve the matching documentation for steps, references, and examples when applying code changes. 


<Note>AI can make mistakes even with access to the latest documentation. Make sure to review AI generated code for accuracy.</Note>

## LLM context files
To support integrating with LLMs directly or for LLMs to navigate and search the documentation, the following files are available:

- **llms.txt:** `https://auth0.com/ai/docs/llms.txt`
- **llms-full.txt:** `https://auth0.com/ai/docs/llms-full.txt`
- **Markdown versions of each page:** available by clicking on the **Copy page** button at the top of each page, or by appending `.md` to any page URL.

Using the Auth for GenAI MCP server is the recommended approach for ensuring your AI tools have the latest information.
