Connect your AI agents to Basecamp for project management, collaboration, and automation across projects, tasks, messages, schedules, and documents.

When used with Auth0's [Token Vault](https://auth0-genai.mintlify.app/intro/token-vault), this connection can enable use cases such as:
- **Project management automation**: Create projects, manage to-do lists, and track progress across teams.
- **Team collaboration**: Access messages, documents, and schedules to facilitate AI-powered team workflows.
- **Task and deadline tracking**: Monitor project milestones, upcoming deadlines, and team assignments.
- **Communication insights**: Analyze team discussions and project updates to provide intelligent summaries and recommendations.
- **Document management**: Access and organize project documents, files, and rich content attachments.
- **Real-time notifications**: Stay updated on project changes, new messages, and task completions.
