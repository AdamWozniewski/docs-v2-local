The GitHub integration allows your AI Agents to authenticate users with their GitHub accounts and access GitHub repositories and manage issues their behalf.

## Overview

The GitHub integration is perfect for developer focused AI applications that need to interact with code repositories, manage issues, or automate development workflows. This integration provides access to both public and private repositories based on user permissions.

<b>Troubleshooting</b>

If you are receiving `Access Denied` when calling the GitHub API, you probably have not requested the correct permissions for the user during login. To learn more, see [Add scopes/permissions to call Identity Provider's APIs](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/adding-scopes-for-an-external-idp).
