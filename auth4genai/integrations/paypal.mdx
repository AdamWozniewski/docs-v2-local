Connect your AI agents to Paypal for payment processing, transaction management, and financial insights.
 It is designed for applications that need to interact with Paypal's payment gateway, manage transactions, and provide seamless checkout experiences.

- Integrate with creative processes: connect product assets with other tools and services.
