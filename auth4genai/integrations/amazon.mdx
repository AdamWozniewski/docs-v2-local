Connect your AI Agents to Amazon for e-commerce capabilities, product management, and order
processing. It's designed for applications that need to interact with Amazon's product catalog, manage orders, and provide personalized shopping experiences.

When used with Auth0's [Token Vault](https://auth0-genai.mintlify.app/intro/token-vault), this connection can enable use cases such as:
- Access product information: retrieve product details, pricing, and availability from Amazon.
- Support AI-powered workflows: use product data to generate insights or automate e-commerce tasks.
- Integrate with creative processes: connect product assets with other tools and services.
