Connect your AI agents to Amazon for e-commerce capabilities, product management, and order
processing. It is designed for applications that need to interact with Amazon's product catalog, manage orders, and provide personalized shopping experiences.

- Access product information: retrieve product details, pricing, and availability from Amazon.
