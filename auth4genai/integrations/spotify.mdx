Connect your AI agent to a user's Spotify account to create and modify playlists or add songs to their library.

## Connect Spotify to Auth0

<Steps>
  <Step title="Spotify setup">
    1. Sign up for a [Spotify Developer account](https://developer.spotify.com/).
    2. Create a new app in the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
    3. Make sure to select the API/SDKs you plan to use for your application.
    4. Configure Redirect URIs:
       - Redirect URL: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/login/callback`
       <FindDomainInfoBlock />
    5. When you click **Save** you will be redirected to the configuration page for the application you just created. You will see **Client ID** and can select _View Client Secret_ to see your **Client Secret**. Make sure to note them down for the next steps:
       - **Client ID**  (OAuth client_id)
       - **Client Secret** (OAuth client_secret)
