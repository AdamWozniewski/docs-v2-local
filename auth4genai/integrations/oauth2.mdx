The custom OAuth2 connection allows you to create integrations with any OAuth2 compliant service that isn't available as a built-in integration type.

## Overview

If a specific identity provider or service isn't available out of the box, Auth0 allows you to create custom social connections. This is particularly useful for integrating with proprietary systems, regional services, or specialized OAuth2 providers.

To learn more and configure a custom OAuth2 connection with Auth0, see our [Connect Apps to Generic OAuth2 Authorization Servers documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/social-identity-providers/oauth2).

## Configure Token Vault

After creating the connection, at the bottom of the connection settings in the `Advanced` section enable the `Enable Token Vault` toggle. This will allow your connection to retrieve and store access tokens for third-party APIs.

## Account linking

If you want to use more than one connection for a user, you can link their accounts. This allows the user to log in with any of their linked accounts and have a single user profile in your application. This allows calling APIs from different providers with a single user profile. Learn more about [Client-initiated account linking](/guides/client-initiated-account-linking).

## Learn more

- Auth0's [Token Vault](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault) organizes the access and refresh tokens of federated connections in secure tokensets. Applications can then access the Token Vault to retrieve access tokens to call third-party APIs. To learn more, read [Configure Token Vault](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault/configure-token-vault).
