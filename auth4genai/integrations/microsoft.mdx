The Microsoft integration enables your application to authenticate users with their Microsoft accounts and access Microsoft 365 services through Token Vault.

## Overview

The Microsoft integration provides enterprise-grade integration with Microsoft's ecosystem, including Office 365, Azure AD, and Microsoft Graph APIs. This integration is essential for B2B applications where users need to access their work data and collaborate through Microsoft services.

## Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up Azure account">
    1. [Sign up for an account on the Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio)
    2. [Create an Azure AD Tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/quickstart-tenant-setup)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up app in Microsoft">
    1. Register an app in Azure using Microsoft's [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) documentation.
    2. During this process, Microsoft will generate an **Application (client) ID** and a **Client Secret** for your application; make note of these.
    1. Use the following settings when configuring your app:
      - Redirect URI: `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/login/callback`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
<b>Find your Auth0 domain name</b>

If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your redirect URI will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.

### Configure federated connection

You will need to configure your connection so it can retrieve and store access tokens for third-party APIs. Auth0's [Token Vault](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault) organizes the access and refresh tokens of federated connections in secure tokensets. Applications can then access the Token Vault to retrieve access tokens to call third-party APIs.

To learn more, read [Configure Token Vault](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault/configure-token-vault).
