### Configure Token Vault

You will need to configure your connection so it can retrieve and store access tokens for third-party APIs. Auth0's [Token Vault](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault) organizes the access and refresh tokens of federated connections in secure tokensets. Applications can then access the Token Vault to retrieve access tokens to call third-party APIs.
