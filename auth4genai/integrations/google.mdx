Google is a popular social connection that allows users to log in to your application using their Google profile. 

## Overview

To set up a Google social connection, you must:

- Create Google OAuth credentials with the Google Auth Platform.
- Configure and test a Google social connection with the Auth0 Dashboard.

## Configuration

<Info>
The Google Auth Platform helps you manage your applications and OAuth credentials for logging in and calling Google APIs. To learn more, read [Get started with the Google Auth Platform](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15544987?hl=en). 

Use the Google Auth Platform to:

1. Configure Google consent screen
2. Create Google OAuth 2.0 Client

</Info>

To configure the Google Integration for your GenAI application:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Google consent screen">
  When you use OAuth 2.0 for authorization, your application requests authorization for one or more scopes of access from a Google Account. Google displays a consent screen to the user, including a summary of your project, its policies, and the requested access scopes.
  Before creating an OAuth client ID, you must first configure the OAuth consent screen with information about your application.
  <Warning>
    If your application requests sensitive OAuth scopes or uses a custom image, [Google limits it to 100 logins until the OAuth consent screen is verified](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/client-verification). Consent screen verification may take up to several days.
  </Warning>
  In the Google Cloud Console, [configure your Google OAuth consent screen:](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent):
    1. Navigate to **Google Auth Platform > Branding:**
    For **Authorized domains**, enter auth0.com. If you’re using a custom domain, enter your custom domain instead.
    2. Navigate to **Google Auth Platform > Audience:**
    For **User type**, select **Make External.** In **Test Users,** you can add the email addresses you want to use for testing.  
    3. Navigate to **Google Auth Platform > Data Access** to add or remove scopes. To learn more, read [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs.](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) 
    4. Follow the rest of the instructions to finish [configuring your Google OAuth consent screen.](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent)
    5. Select **Save Changes.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure custom domain">
  To create a Google OAuth 2.0 Client, you need your Auth0 domain, which you can find in the Auth0 Dashboard. 
  1. Navigate to **Settings > Custom Domains.**
  2. If you haven’t configured a custom domain, your Auth0 domain name is `{YOUR_TENANT_NAME}.{YOUR_REGIONAL_SUBDOMAIN}.auth0.com.` It will be bolded in the introduction. Your redirect URI is `https://{YOUR_TENANT_NAME}.{YOUR_REGIONAL_SUBDOMAIN}.auth0.com/login/callback.`
  3. If you have configured a custom domain, use your custom domain instead. Your redirect URI is `https://{YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/login/callback.`
  <Info>
  If you created your US tenant before June 2020, then your Auth0 domain name does not include the regional subdomain: `{YOUR_TENANT_NAME}.auth0.com.`
  </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Google OAuth 2.0 Client">
  In the Google Cloud Console, [create a new OAuth 2.0 Client:](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients/create)
  1. Navigate to **Google Auth Platform > Clients.** Then, select **New Client.**
  2. For the **Application type,** select **Web application.**
  3. Enter the following information for your OAuth 2.0 Client:
  * Name: The name of your OAuth 2.0 Client. 
  * Authorized Javascript origins: `https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}`
  * Authorized redirect URIs: `https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}/login/callback`
  4. Select **Create.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Google social connection in the Auth0 dashboard">
  Use the Auth0 Dashboard to create and configure a Google social connection with the proper OAuth credentials. 
    1. Navigate to **Authentication > Social.**
    2. Select **Create Connection** and then **Google/Gmail.** 
    3. In **General,** enter the client credentials from the Google OAuth 2.0 Client you created:
    * Client ID: The unique identifier for your application. 
    * Client Secret: The secret used by the application to authenticate with Auth0. To learn more, read [Client secret authentication.](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/application-credentials#client-secret-authentication)
