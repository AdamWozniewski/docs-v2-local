The Sign in with Slack integration enables your AI Agents to authenticate users with their Slack accounts and interact with Slack workspaces on their behalf.

<Info>
  By default, Auth0 automatically syncs user profile data with each user login,
  thereby ensuring that changes made in the connection source are automatically
  updated in Auth0. Optionally, you can [disable user profile data
  synchronization](https://auth0.com/docs/users/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0)
  to allow for updating profile attributes from your application.
</Info>

## Overview

The Sign in with Slack integration is ideal for AI agents that need to participate in team communications, automate workflows, or provide intelligent assistance within Slack workspaces. This connection provides access to messages, channels, and workspace data.

## Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up app in Slack">
    1. Sign up for a [Slack Developer account](https://slack.com/signin)
    2. If you haven't already, create a [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps/new)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure for Auth0">
    1. Once your app is created, copy and paste the Client ID and Client Secret into the Auth0 configuration screen.
    2. Next, click on OAuth & Permissions in the Features menu on the left. Use the following settings when configuring your app:
      - Redirect URI: `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/login/callback`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Token Vault configuration Example

To configure the Token Vault for your GitHub connection, you can use the following code snippet in your application:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript" icon="js">
    ```tsx wrap lines
    const auth0AI = new Auth0AI();

    export const withSlackConnection = auth0AI.withTokenForConnection({
      connection: "sign-in-with-slack",
      scopes: ["channels:read", ...],
      refreshToken: getAuth0RefreshToken(),
    });
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python" icon="python">
    ```python wrap lines
    auth0_ai = Auth0AI()

    with_slack_connection = auth0_ai.with_federated_connection(
        connection="sign-in-with-slack",
        scopes=["channels:read", ...],
        refresh_token=get_auth0_refresh_token,
    )
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Account linking

If you want to use more than one connection for a user, you can link their accounts. This allows the user to log in with any of their linked accounts and have a single user profile in your application. This allows calling APIs from different providers with a single user profile. Learn more about [Client-initiated account linking](/guides/client-initiated-account-linking).

## Learn more

- Auth0's [Token Vault](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault) organizes the access and refresh tokens of federated connections in secure tokensets. Applications can then access the Token Vault to retrieve access tokens to call third-party APIs. To learn more, read [Configure Token Vault](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault/configure-token-vault).
