The Sign in with Slack integration enables your AI Agents to authenticate users with their Slack accounts and interact with Slack workspaces on their behalf.

<Info>
By default, Auth0 automatically syncs user profile data with each user login, thereby ensuring that changes made in the connection source are automatically updated in Auth0. Optionally, you can [disable user profile data synchronization](https://auth0.com/docs/users/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0) to allow for updating profile attributes from your application.
