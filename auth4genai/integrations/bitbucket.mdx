Connect your AI agents to Bitbucket for source code collaboration, repository management, and DevOps workflow.
It is designed for applications that need to interact with Bitbucket's repositories, manage pull requests, and facilitate team collaboration.

When used with Auth0's [Token Vault](https://auth0-genai.mintlify.app/intro/token-vault), this connection can enable use cases such as:
- Access repository information: retrieve repository details, branch information, and commit history from Bitbucket.
- Support AI-powered workflows: use repository data to generate insights or automate DevOps tasks.
- Integrate with development pipelines: connect Bitbucket projects with CICD tools and services.
