## Account linking

If you want to use more than one connection for a user, you can link their accounts. This allows the user to log in with any of their linked accounts and have a single user profile in your application. This allows calling APIs from different providers with a single user profile. Learn more about [Client-initiated account linking](/guides/client-initiated-account-linking).
