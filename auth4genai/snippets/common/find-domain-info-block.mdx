<strong>Find your Auth0 domain name</strong>

You can find the domain in the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/).

1. If you haven't configured a custom domain, your Auth0 domain name is `{YOUR_TENANT_NAME}.{YOUR_REGIONAL_SUBDOMAIN}.auth0.com`. You can find this under **Applications &gt; [Your Application] &gt; Settings &gt; Basic Information &gt; Domain**. Your redirect/callback URI is `https://{YOUR_TENANT_NAME}.{YOUR_REGIONAL_SUBDOMAIN}.auth0.com/login/callback`.
2. If you have configured a [custom domain](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains) via **Settings > Custom Domains** in your Auth0 Dashboard, use your custom domain instead. Your redirect URI is `https://{YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/login/callback`.

If you created your US tenant before June 2020, then your Auth0 domain name does not include the regional subdomain. It will be: `{YOUR_TENANT_NAME}.auth0.com`.
