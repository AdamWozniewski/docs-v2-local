## Add Connection in Auth0
In the Auth0 Dashboard, navigate to `Authentication` > `Social` and select `Create Connection`. Then, choose the matching connection from the list of supported options to add and begin the configuration process. Follow the prompts to configure your selected provider.

### Enable Token Vault
