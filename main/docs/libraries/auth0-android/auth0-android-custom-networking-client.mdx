import {AuthCodeBlock} from "/snippets/AuthCodeBlock.jsx";

This library provides lets you customize the behavior of the networking client for common configurations and define and use your own networking client implementation.

You can configure the Auth0 class with a `NetworkingClient`, which will be used when making requests. You can configure the default client with custom timeout values, any headers that should be sent on all requests, and whether to log request/response info (for non-production debugging purposes only). For more advanced configuration, you can provide your own implementation of `NetworkingClient`.

### Timeout configuration

export const codeExample1 = `val netClient = DefaultClient(
    connectTimeout = 30,
    readTimeout = 30
)

val account = Auth0("{yourClientId}", "{yourDomain}")
account.networkingClient = netClient`;

<AuthCodeBlock children={codeExample1} language="kotlin" />

### Logging configuration

export const codeExample2 = `val netClient = DefaultClient(
    enableLogging = true
)

val account = Auth0("{yourClientId}", "{yourDomain}")
account.networkingClient = netClient`;

<AuthCodeBlock children={codeExample2} language="kotlin" />

### Set additional headers for all requests

export const codeExample3 = `val netClient = DefaultClient(
    defaultHeaders = mapOf("{HEADER-NAME}" to "{HEADER-VALUE}")
)

val account = Auth0("{yourClientId}", "{yourDomain}")
account.networkingClient = netClient`;

<AuthCodeBlock children={codeExample3} language="kotlin" />

### Advanced configuration

For more advanced configuration of the networking client, you can provide a custom implementation of `NetworkingClient`. This may be useful when you want to reuse your own networking client, configure a proxy, and so on.

export const codeExample4 = `class CustomNetClient : NetworkingClient {
    override fun load(url: String, options: RequestOptions): ServerResponse {
        // Create and execute the request to the specified URL with the given options
        val response = // ...

        // Return a ServerResponse from the received response data
        return ServerResponse(responseCode, responseBody, responseHeaders)        
    }
}

val account = Auth0("{yourClientId}", "{yourDomain}")
account.networkingClient = netClient`;

<AuthCodeBlock children={codeExample4} language="kotlin" />
