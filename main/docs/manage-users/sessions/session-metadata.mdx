<Warning>

Session Metadata is currently in Early Access for Enterprise customers only. By using this feature, you agree to the applicable Free Trial terms in Okta’s [Master Subscription Agreement](https://www.okta.com/legal). To learn more about Auth0's product release cycle, read [Product Release Stages](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages).

</Warning>

Session metadata allows the storage of customizable keys and values (maximum 255 characters each) in an Auth0 user [session](/docs/manage-users/sessions). 

Use cases for session metadata include:

* Track device information, such as device name or login location
* Store session-level flags, for example, `user_accepted_terms`
* Share state between multiple Actions in the same flow
* Drive conditional logic for logout or token issuance

You can use session metadata information downstream systems such as audit, analytics, and revocation pipelines that may need to be aware of a user’s organization data. 

To learn more, read [Use case: Organization Information in Session Metadata](/docs/manage-users/sessions/session-metadata/add-organization-information). 

You can access and modify session metadata during a session’s [lifecycle](/docs/manage-users/sessions/session-lifecycle) using Auth0 [Actions](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger) and the [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2). In addition, you can include session metadata in the [OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout](/docs/authenticate/login/logout/back-channel-logout) token.

To learn more, read [how to Configure Session Metadata](/docs/manage-users/sessions/session-metadata/configure-session-metadata). 

## Limitations

* Auth0 does not support session metadata with the following:
	* Resource Owner Password Flow
	* Native Passkeys
	* Native Social Logins such as Sign in with Apple, Google, or Facebook
