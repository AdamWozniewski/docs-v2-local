An Auth0 session lifecycle begins when a user logs in, remains active with user interaction, and ends when the session expires or is explicitly terminated. 

Auth0 considers a session active when a user interacts with the Authorization server. 

For example:

* Calls to the [/authorize](/docs/api/authentication/authorization-code-flow/authorize-application) endpoint 
* Issue [silent authentication](/docs/authenticate/login/configure-silent-authentication)
* Log in to a new application using [single sign on](/docs/authenticate/single-sign-on)

A session can be persistent or non-persistent; this allows you to configure how a session cookie behaves in a browser. 

* **Persistent sessions** store cookies with a future expiration timestamp.
* **Non-persistent sessions** store cookies with `Expires=0`. It tells the browser to delete the cookie when the browser is closed.

Session cookie persistence behavior depends on the browser implementation. Auth0 cannot guarantee that all browsers will delete non-persistent cookies as expected.

## Session lifetime

Persistent and non-persistent sessions can be configured with their own Idle and Absolute (Maximum) lifetimes to define a session expiration.

### Idle timeout

Idle timeout defines the maximum duration of inactivity allowed. Each time a user interacts with Auth0 via Single Sign-On (SSO), silent authentication or /authorize, the idle timer resets. If no interaction with Auth0 happens during the configured period, the session expires.

### Absolute timeout (Maximum)

Absolute timeout defines the maximum duration a session can remain valid regardless of user activity. Once absolute timeout is reached, the session expires and the user will need to reauthenticate.

Learn how to [Configure Session Lifetime](/docs/manage-users/sessions/configure-session-lifetime).

## Session lifetime limits

Session lifetime has the following limits:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Session type</strong></th>
<th><strong>Timeout type</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
<th><strong>Maximum (Self-Service plans)</strong></th>
<th><strong>Maximum (Enterprise Plans)</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Non-persistent</td>
<td>Inactivity timeout</td>
<td>Timeframe after which a session expires if there’s no interaction with the Authorization Server</td>
<td>3 days</td>
<td>100 days</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Require Login after</td>
<td>Maximum session lifetime, regardless of activity</td>
<td>30 days</td>
<td>365 days</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Persistent</td>
<td>Inactivity timeout</td>
<td>Timeframe after which a session expires if there’s no interaction with the Authorization Server</td>
<td>3 days</td>
<td>100 days</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Require Login after</td>
<td>Maximum session lifetime, regardless of activity</td>
<td>30 days</td>
<td>365 days</td>
</tr>
