Your Auth0 domain is your tenant name, your regional subdomain, and `auth0.com`, unless your tenant was created before June 2020 in the US region.

Example: If your tenant name is Travel0 and your region US, then your Auth0 domain is `travel0.us.auth0.com.` If your tenant was created before June 2020 in the US region, then your domain name would be `https://travel0.auth0.com`.
