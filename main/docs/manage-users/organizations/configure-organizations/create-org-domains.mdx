Use Organization domains during the login flows to include a prompt for users to choose the correct Organization. When configured, verified domains help Auth0 detect a userâ€™s organization automatically or narrow organization options when users enter their email address.

To learn more, read [Login Flows for Organizations](/docs/manage-users/organizations/login-flows-for-organizations).

<b>Find your Auth0 domain</b>

Your Auth0 domain is your tenant name, your regional subdomain, and `auth0.com`, unless your tenant was created before June 2020 in the US region.

Example: If your tenant name is Travel0 and your region US, then your Auth0 domain is `travel0.us.auth0.com.` If your tenant was created before June 2020 in the US region, then your domain name would be `https://travel0.auth0.com`.

If you have a custom domains configured and verified in Auth0 Dashboard, your domain is your custom domain name. To learn more, read [Custom Domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains).
